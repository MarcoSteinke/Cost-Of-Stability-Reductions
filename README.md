# Reductions-from-Sigma2-SAT-to-m-ω-vertex-cost-of-stability-and ω-vertex-cost-of-stability

## Introduction:

This repository contains implementations of polynomial-time many-one reductions ($\leq^P_m$) from Sigma_2-SAT to m-ω-vertex-cost-of-stability and ω-vertex-cost-of-stability. Both reductions were implemented in python using jupyter notebooks. Since both m-ω-vertex-cost-of-stability and ω-vertex-cost-of-stability are graph problems based on the CLIQUE-problem, the graph library `networkx` was used to construct, analyze and draw graphs.

## Usage:

1️⃣ Clone this repository using `git clone`.

2️⃣ Navigate into the cloned repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies

3️⃣ Start `jupyter` or any code editor/IDE which is capable of rendering `.ipynb` files.

4️⃣ Always run `ALL` code blocks inside of the jupyter notebook, since later code blocks override previous ones for educational purposes.
