# Reductions-from-Sigma2-SAT-to-m-ω-VCS-and ω-VCS

This repository contains implementations of reductions ($\leq^P_m$) from $\Sigma^P_2$-SAT to $m-\omega$-VCS and $\omega$-VCS. Both reductions were implemented in python using jupyter notebooks.

## Usage:

1️⃣ Clone this repository using `git clone`.

2️⃣ Start `jupyter` or any code editor/IDE which is capable of rendering `.ipynb` files.

3️⃣ Always run `ALL` code blocks inside of the jupyter notebook, since later code blocks override previous ones for educational purposes.
